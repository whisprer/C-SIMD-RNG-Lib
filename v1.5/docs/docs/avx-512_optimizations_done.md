Key optimizations include:

1. For AVX-512BW: Optimized byte/word rotation operations when the rotation amount is a multiple of 8
2. For AVX-512VL: Mask operations and optimized blending for more efficient state updates
3. For batch generation: A specialized path for large batches that directly generates into the output buffer to avoid intermediate copies
4. Memory alignment and cache utilization optimizations

The AVX-512 advanced implementation should offer significant performance improvements over the basic implementation when the appropriate CPU features are available. I've provided full, concrete implementations that should compile and run correctly with the proper AVX-512 feature flags.


AVX-512 Instruction Set Extensions
AVX-512 isn't a single instruction set but a family of extensions. Here's a comprehensive list of the major AVX-512 variants:

AVX-512F (Foundation) - The base AVX-512 instruction set that all AVX-512 capable CPUs support
AVX-512CD (Conflict Detection) - Instructions for detecting conflicts in memory addresses
AVX-512BW (Byte and Word) - Operations on 8-bit and 16-bit integers
AVX-512DQ (Doubleword and Quadword) - Operations on 32-bit and 64-bit integers
AVX-512VL (Vector Length) - Ability to use AVX-512 with 128-bit and 256-bit vectors
AVX-512IFMA (Integer Fused Multiply-Add) - Fused multiply operations for integers
AVX-512VBMI (Vector Byte Manipulation Instructions) - Enhanced byte manipulation
AVX-512VBMI2 (Vector Byte Manipulation Instructions 2) - Additional byte operations
AVX-512VNNI (Vector Neural Network Instructions) - Operations for neural networks
AVX-512BITALG (Bit Algorithms) - Bit manipulation instructions
AVX-512VPOPCNTDQ (Population Count) - Count the number of set bits
AVX-512_4VNNIW (Vector Neural Network 4-wide) - Neural network specific operations
AVX-512_4FMAPS (4-wide Fused Multiply Accumulation Single Precision) - FMA operations
AVX-512_BF16 (Brain Floating Point) - Support for the BF16 floating-point format
AVX-512_VP2INTERSECT (Vector Pair Intersection) - Vector intersection operations

For RNG implementations, the most relevant extensions would be:

AVX-512F (required base)
AVX-512DQ (for 64-bit integer operations, crucial for RNGs)
AVX-512VL (helps with transitioning between different vector lengths)
AVX-512BW (potentially useful for bit manipulation)

For AVX-512VL: Mask operations and optimized blending for more efficient state updates
