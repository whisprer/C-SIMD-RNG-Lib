key design principles and performance considerations I've applied across these SIMD implementations:

Consistent Architecture

Each implementation follows an identical pattern:

Class-based state management
Uniform method signatures
Consistent seeding strategy
Pre-generation of random numbers
Batch generation support



Parallelism Level - should see significant performance differences between:

- The scalar implementation
- SSE2 implementation (2-way)
- AVX2 implementation (4-way)
- Basic AVX-512 implementation (8-way)
- Advanced AVX-512 implementation (8-way with additional optimizations)
- [openCL GPU accelerated processing, up to (1024-way)]


Seeding Strategy

Uses SplitMix64 algorithm for high-quality seed generation
Creates slightly different seeds for each parallel stream
Ensures good initial state distribution


Performance Optimization Techniques

Pre-generates batches of random numbers
Reduces computational overhead by reusing generated values
Minimizes state update frequency
Uses direct SIMD instructions for maximum speed


Memory Efficiency

Stores only a small buffer of pre-generated numbers
Dynamically regenerates batches when needed
Minimal memory footprint



Performance Considerations:

The implementations prioritize speed through:

Parallel stream generation
Vectorized operations
Minimal branching
Efficient state updates



The core algorithm remains the xoroshiro128++ variant, known for:

Good statistical properties
Fast generation
Low state size
