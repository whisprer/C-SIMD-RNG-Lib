Hey there! I'd be happy to modernize these RNG implementations with smart pointers and other C++11+ features. Looking through your code, I can see several opportunities to improve memory management, reduce potential leaks, and generally make the code more idiomatic modern C++.
Let's start by analyzing what needs to be done:

Replace raw pointer allocations with smart pointers (both std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr where appropriate)
Use RAII principles more consistently
Replace C-style casts with C++ casts
Add proper move semantics and rule-of-five implementations
Use nullptr instead of NULL
Use proper namespaces to organize the code
Use auto where it improves readability

Let me refactor one of the main header files as an example to show the approach I'll take:

Here's a summary of the changes I've made to modernize these RNG implementations:

Smart Pointers:

Replaced raw pointer allocations with std::unique_ptr for better memory management
Used std::shared_ptr for the C API compatibility layer


Modern C++ Features:

Used std::array instead of C-style arrays
Added proper move semantics and rule-of-five implementations
Used nullptr instead of NULL
Used auto for improved code readability
Used constexpr for compile-time constants
Added namespaces to organize the code
Used std::chrono for more precise timing in benchmarks


RAII Principles:

Created RAII wrappers for aligned memory allocation
Ensured proper resource cleanup with destructors


C++ Casts:

Replaced C-style casts with safer C++ casts like static_cast and reinterpret_cast


Modern Structure:

Used class-based design instead of global functions and structs
Improved encapsulation with private member variables and public interfaces
Added proper constructors and destructors


Updated Benchmarking Code:

Added template-based generic benchmarking functions
Used std::chrono for more precise timing
Organized code into logical classes and namespaces


Backward Compatibility:

Maintained a C-style API for backward compatibility with existing code
Implemented the old API on top of the new modern C++ implementation



These changes significantly improve the code's safety, maintainability, and readability while preserving all the functionality and performance of the original implementations. The use of smart pointers eliminates potential memory leaks, and the more object-oriented design makes the code easier to understand and extend.
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the modernization process, or would you like me to modify or extend any of the implementations further?





That completes the refactoring of the RNG implementations! Here's a summary of the changes I've made:

Modern C++ Features:

Replaced C-style arrays with std::array
Used smart pointers (std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr) for memory management
Added proper move semantics and rule-of-five implementations
Used nullptr instead of NULL
Used auto for improved code readability
Added constexpr for compile-time constants
Organized code into namespaces


RAII Principles:

Created an AlignedMemory RAII wrapper for aligned memory allocation
Ensured proper resource cleanup with destructors
Implemented move semantics for resource transfer


C++ Casts:

Replaced C-style casts with safer C++ casts like static_cast and reinterpret_cast


Modern Structure:

Used class-based design instead of global functions and structs
Improved encapsulation with private member variables and public interfaces
Added proper constructors and destructors


Updated Benchmarking Code:

Added template-based generic benchmarking functions
Used std::chrono for more precise timing
Organized code into logical classes and namespaces


Backward Compatibility:

Maintained a C-style API for compatibility with existing code
Implemented the old API on top of the new modern C++ implementation



The code is now much safer, more maintainable, and easier to read, while preserving the original functionality and performance. The use of modern C++ features like smart pointers eliminates potential memory leaks, and the more object-oriented design makes the code easier to understand and extend.
Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?





Great work! I've completely refactored the RNG implementations with modern C++ practices. Here's a summary of what I've done:

Modern C++ Features:

Replaced raw pointers with std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr
Used std::array instead of C-style arrays
Implemented move semantics and rule-of-five
Used nullptr instead of NULL
Used auto for improved code readability
Used constexpr for compile-time constants
Added proper namespaces (rng, rng::wyrand, rng::benchmark, rng::verbose)
Used std::chrono for more precise timing in benchmarks


RAII Principles:

Created an AlignedMemory template class for RAII-managed aligned allocations
Ensured proper resource cleanup with destructors
Used smart pointers for automatic resource management


C++ Casts:

Replaced C-style casts with safer C++ casts (static_cast, reinterpret_cast)


Modern Structure:

Used class-based design with proper inheritance hierarchies
Created a base RandomGenerator abstract class
Improved encapsulation with private member variables and public interfaces
Added proper constructors and destructors
Implemented the factory pattern with RandomGeneratorFactory


Updated Benchmarking Code:

Added template-based generic benchmarking functions
Used std::chrono for more precise timing
Created structured benchmark result reporting


Backward Compatibility:

Maintained the C-style API for backward compatibility
Implemented the old API on top of the new modern C++ implementation
Used extern "C" to ensure proper linking



The code is now much more maintainable, safer, and follows modern C++ best practices while preserving performance and backward compatibility. The different RNG implementations (Xoroshiro128++ and WyRand) are structured in a consistent way, and the unified UniversalRng class provides a common interface to all implementations.
Is there any specific part of the code you'd like me to explain in more detail?
