An Improved C++ RNG - Code Overview:

within this .md is a concise overview of each code file based on the project's goal of creating a universal, high-performance random number generator (RNG) that can adapt to different hardware architectures.

The design pattern is quite elegant, with a dispatching mechanism that selects the best available SIMD implementation at runtime. This provides both performance and compatibility across different CPU architectures.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CORE FILES:

compiler.bat:

It automatically detects CPU capabilities and compiles the code with appropriate optimization flags for SSE2, AVX2, or AVX-512 instruction sets, allowing for flexible compilation across different hardware. The compiler.bat script is responsible for detecting CPU features and compiling with appropriate SIMD flags.

runtime_detect.cpp and runtime_detect.h:
These files implement CPU feature detection across different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS). They identify available SIMD instruction sets like SSE2, AVX, AVX2, and various AVX-512 extensions, which are crucial for selecting the most appropriate RNG implementation for the current hardware. runtime_detect.cpp/.h handle CPU feature detection at runtime.

universal_rng.cpp and universal_rng.h:
The core implementation of the universal RNG. These files provide a flexible, runtime-adaptable random number generator that can automatically select the most appropriate implementation (scalar, SSE2, AVX2, or AVX-512) based on the detected CPU features. universal_rng.cpp/.h provide a unified interface for the various implementations.
