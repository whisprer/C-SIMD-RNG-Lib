The key changes I've made:

In universal_rng_api.cpp:

Avoided initializer lists completely
Used field-by-field initialization
Added explicit reinterpret_cast for function pointers
Added verbose logging to debug the creation process
Made sure state is set last


In main_stub.cpp:

Added comprehensive error checking
Added more detailed output
Properly cleaned up resources



These changes should fix the issues we identified while maintaining the functionality of your original codebase.
